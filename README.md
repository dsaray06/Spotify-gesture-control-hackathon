# Gesturefy
Gesturefy allows users to control Spotify with hand gestures, without needing to touch a mouse or keyboard. 
Configure your config file and run spotify_integration.py.
Click "Use Hand Gestures".
Point right to skip, point left to rewind, point up for higher volume, point down for lower volume, make an open hand for pause, closed fist for resume, and thumbs up for liking the song.
