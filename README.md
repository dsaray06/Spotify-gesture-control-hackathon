# Spotify gesture control
Gesture control logic for an app I will be making in the future: Gesturefy
Gesturefy will allow users to control Spotify with hand gestures, without needing to touch a mouse or keyboard. 

For this project:
Configure your config file with client ID and secret from your Spotify dev account, and run spotify_integration.py.
Click "Use Hand Gestures" in the Spotify app on your computer.
Point right to skip, point left to rewind, point up for higher volume, point down for lower volume, make an open hand for pause, closed fist for resume, and thumbs up for liking the song.
